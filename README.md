# Electric Parking Brake (EPB) System Development

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete development artifacts for an **Electric Parking Brake (EPB) system** designed for automotive applications with **ASIL-D safety requirements** per ISO 26262.

## 🚗 System Description

The Electric Parking Brake system replaces traditional handbrake mechanisms with an electronic actuator system that provides:
- **Automated brake engagement/disengagement**
- **Hill hold assistance**  
- **Emergency braking capability**
- **Integration with vehicle systems via CAN bus**
- **Comprehensive safety monitoring and fault detection**
